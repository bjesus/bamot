Bamot will be a RubyOnRails CMS for sharing all kinds of art.
  it will include an automatic system for generating a newspaper
  out of the content it has.

Development is currently Hebrew only.


Not much to see yet.
We're starting with HTML5&CSS3&JS design, and you'll need Haml to generate the html and css files.
